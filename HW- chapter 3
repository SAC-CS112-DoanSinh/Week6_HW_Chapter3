3.1
a) Each class declaration that begins with keyword public must be stored in a file that has exactly the same name as the class and ends with the .java file – name extension.
b) Keyword class in a class declaration is followed immediately by the class’s name.
c) Keyword new requests memory from the system to store an object, then calls the corresponding class’s constructor to initialize the object.
d) Each parameter must specify both a type and a name.
e) By default, classes that are compiled in the same directory are considered to be in the same package, known as the default package.
f) When each object of a class maintains its own copy of an attribute, the field that represents the attribute is also known as an instance variable.
g) Java provides two primitive types for storing floating-point numbers in memory: float and double.
h) Variables of type double represent double-precision floating-point numbers.
i) Scanner method nextDouble returns a double value.
j) Keyword public is an access modifier.
K) Return type void indicates that a method will not return a value.
l) Scanner method nextLine reads characters until it encounters a newline character, then returns those characters as s String.
m) Class String is in package java.lang.
n) An import declaration is not required if you always refer to a class with its fully qualified class name.
o) A floating-point number is a number with a decimal point, such as 7.33, 0.0975 or 1000.12345.
p) Variables of type float represent single-precision floating-point numbers.
q) The format specifier %f is used to output values of type float or double.
r) Types in Java are divided into two categories primitive types and reference types.

3.2
a) False. Method names begin with a lowercase first letter and all subsequent words in the name begin with
a capital first letter.
b) True
c) True
d) True
e) False. A primitive type variable cannot be used to invoke a method. 
Because a reference to an object is required to invoke the object’s methods.
f) False. The local variables can be used only in the method in which they’re declared.
g) True
h) False. Primitive type instance variables are initialized by default. 
Each local variable must explicitly be assigned a value.
i) True
j) True
k) True
l) False. Literals are of type double by default.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3
A local variable is declared in the body of a method and can be used only from the point
at which it’s declared through the end of the method declaration. 
A field is declared in a class, but not in the body of any of the class’s method. 
Also, fields are accessible to all methods of the class. 

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4
A parameter represents additional information that a method requires to perform its task. 
Each parameter required by a method is specified in the method’s declaration.
An argument is the actual value for a method parameter. 
When a method is called, the argument values are passed to the corresponding parameters of the method so that it can perform its task.
